# Companion Scripts

## Script Boundaries

Bash files under `trellis/workflows/guru-team/scripts/bash/` are thin wrappers.
They should use `set -euo pipefail`, resolve their own `SCRIPT_DIR`, and delegate
behavior to the Python companion:

```bash
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
python3 "$SCRIPT_DIR/../python/guru_team_trellis.py" <subcommand> "$@"
```

Keep argument parsing and workflow logic in
`trellis/workflows/guru-team/scripts/python/guru_team_trellis.py` unless there
is a shell-specific reason to handle it in Bash. Existing examples:

- `trellis/workflows/guru-team/scripts/bash/prepare-task.sh`
- `trellis/workflows/guru-team/scripts/bash/review-branch.sh`
- `trellis/presets/guru-team/scripts/bash/apply.sh`

## Python Runtime Constraints

The companion script is installed into target repositories. Keep it portable:

- Use the Python standard library only.
- Shell out to `git` and `gh` through helper functions such as `run()` and
  `run_stdout()`.
- Use `pathlib.Path` for filesystem paths.
- Use `json.dumps(..., ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)` for user-visible JSON
  payloads and artifacts.
- Keep typed helpers and constants near the top of the file when they define
  reusable contracts.

Reference files:

- `trellis/workflows/guru-team/scripts/python/guru_team_trellis.py`
- `trellis/presets/guru-team/scripts/python/apply_guru_team_trellis_preset.py`

## Error Handling

Use `WorkflowError` for expected workflow failures in
`guru_team_trellis.py`. Include `exit_code=2` for user-actionable blocked states
such as duplicate issue confirmation, missing review-gate evidence, dirty
non-metadata paths, or incomplete Issue Scope Ledger.

The `main()` function prints a JSON error payload to stderr when `--json` is
used. Do not scatter `sys.exit()` calls through helper functions in the workflow
companion.

The preset installer currently uses `SystemExit` for missing `.trellis/` or
missing source directory because it is a small installer script. If adding more
complex failure modes there, preserve JSON output for normal success and avoid
printing secrets or local-only data.

## GitHub and Git Operations

Always gate GitHub operations with `gh auth status` through `require_gh_auth()`.
Do not assume the GitHub CLI is configured just because `gh` exists.

Default `prepare` must be side-effect-free for GitHub and filesystem writes
until the corresponding explicit confirmed/executor flag is present. It may call
`gh issue view/list` for explicit issues and duplicate search, but planner
output must stay on stdout and must not write `.trellis/guru-team/handoff.json`.
It must not call `gh issue create`, `git worktree add`, or `task.py create`
unless the corresponding explicit confirmed/executor flag is present and the
workflow has already required AI/human handoff review. Confirming or creating a
source issue alone still must not write handoff; handoff is written only by
`--create-worktree` or `--create-task` in the chosen workspace.

Before publish, reject uncommitted non-metadata changes. Metadata-only paths are
defined by `METADATA_ONLY_PREFIXES` and `METADATA_ONLY_FILES`; update these
constants deliberately if Trellis metadata ownership changes.

`finish-work.sh` and `publish-pr` are internal helpers, not the normal user
path. `finish-work.sh` must reject ordinary direct calls before archive, journal,
metadata commit, push, or PR side effects; only the explicit
`trellis-finish-work` entrypoint may pass the `--from-trellis-finish-work`
intent marker. `publish-pr` must reject ordinary direct calls before `git push`
or `gh pr create`; only `finish-work` may set the internal publish marker after
archive and journal succeed. A separate explicit recovery/debug flag may exist
for rerunning publish after finish-work already completed, but it still must
pass review gate, dirty state, issue ledger, base branch, and GitHub auth
checks.

Use the intake/task `base_branch` for diff ranges and PR base. Do not fall back
to the GitHub default branch when the task has an explicit base.

For PR body publishing, companion scripts may validate objective Markdown
structure, required sections, forbidden low-information phrases, non-empty
validation / impact / safety content, and Issue Scope Ledger close/ref
semantics. They must not decide whether the release explanation is true or
sufficient; that judgment belongs to the AI readiness review before
`trellis-finish-work`. Non-draft publish must require `--body-file` or
`--body-artifact` inputs that were already reviewed by AI/human; `generated`
bodies are limited to draft/preview paths. `--body-artifact` must carry
`ready: true` and a non-empty `body` or `body_file`. Resolve relative
`body_file` values from the artifact directory, not the repository root.
When `finish-work` archives the active task before publish, rewrite active task
artifact paths to the archived task path and read the final PR body from that
archived artifact.

## Security Rules

Never print or persist tokens, private keys, signed URLs, `.env` contents,
database URLs, or sensitive raw records in logs, JSON artifacts, issues, PR
bodies, or README examples.

When writing temporary PR or issue body files, use `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile`
and unlink the file in a `finally` block. Existing examples:

- `create_issue()`
- `cmd_publish_pr()`

## Validation

For any script change, run:

```bash
bash -n trellis/workflows/guru-team/scripts/bash/*.sh trellis/presets/guru-team/scripts/bash/*.sh
python3 -m py_compile trellis/workflows/guru-team/scripts/python/guru_team_trellis.py trellis/presets/guru-team/scripts/python/apply_guru_team_trellis_preset.py
```

When changing `review-branch`, `finish-work`, or `publish-pr`, also run dry-run
or representative script paths in a disposable worktree whenever practical.

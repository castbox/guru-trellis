# Workflow Mode Selector Contract

This is a semantic Skill with a minimal public handoff. The public input only
identifies the invocation mode and caller continuation. The AI must not infer
the selection from a script, keyword list, or recorder result.

The owner-private result is transient and contains the semantic selection,
confirmation disposition, and current continuation identity. The public DTO
contains only `exit_id`; the consumer is selected by the typed exit. Missing,
stale, duplicate, unknown, or unmapped results fail closed.
